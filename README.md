## About the Project
ðŸ”´ This project is a clocked-based alarm application. You can set alarms at any desired time. The most important feature of this project is its use of local storage in your browser. This means that if you accidentally close the tab or the entire window, the alarm you set is not lost. When you revisit the page, you'll find it in the same state as you left it. It also remembers the time you set the alarm last time.There si also a recent alaram options which shows the recent alaram and we can also delete if we dont want alaram at that point of time.


## Built With
